    "In order to collect data about how people play video games, a research group in Computer Science at UBC set up a MineCraft server to monitor players actions. To run the project smoothly, they have provided us with two data files. Our group will be analyzing player information in the players.csv file to answer Question 1: What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our specific, predictive question is: Can we predict a player's subscription status with \"experience\", \"played_hours\" and \"age\"? If yes, which combination of exploratory variables gives the most accurate prediction for the target variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw players.csv dataset, with data collected from a MineCraft server, contains 196 observations, where each row represents an individual player, and 9 columns, each containing a different variable consisting of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- experience (categorical): The experience level of the player (Amateur,Beginner, Regular, Pro, Veteran)\n",
    "- subscribe (boolean): Indicates whether the player is subscribed to the game-related newsletter (target variable)\n",
    "- hashedEmail (string): Player's email\n",
    "- played_hours (numerical): Total number of hours played\n",
    "- name (string): Player's name\n",
    "- gender(categorical): Player's reported gender\n",
    "- age (numerical): Player's age in years\n",
    "- individualId (N/A, no data): Each player's in-game ID\n",
    "- organizationName (N/A, no data): Player's affiliated organization\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns \"individualId\" and \"organizationName\" contain no data, while columns such as \"name\" and \"hashedEmail\" are identifying variables, not predictive. The types of variables are mixed, making it difficult to plot on same graphs and use same evaluation methods. "

    "The dataset contains multiple variables for each player and also a categorical target variable (True/False). Thus, this question will use KNN classification as the model. The response variable is subscribed, and the explanatory variables are \"experience\", \"played_hours\", and \"age\". We will use KNN classification on these graphs to train the model using an 80-20 training-testing data split to predict \"subscribed\". \n",
    "Then, we will compare 5-fold cross-validation results of the 3 models to find the highest accuracy, precision and recall. The variables of the best-performing graph would then be the variables that are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since KNN only works with numeric values, we must convert \"experience\", a categorical variable, into a number scale (e.g., Amateur = 1, Beginner = 2, Regular = 3, Pro = 4, Veteran = 5). Each KNN model will then be fit using cross-validation to compare accuracy, precision, and recall, allowing us to determine which pair of variables best predicts newsletter subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no assumptions to make about the model, because we are testing through cross-validation. However, when we convert \"experience\" into a number scale, we assume 1 is the lowest, 5 is the highest and assign values to each level of experience based on assumption.\n",

    "- Remove empty/irrelevant columns after checking for missing values\n",
    "- Convert categorical exploratory variable \"experience\" to numeric for KNN. (Limitation: the \"number\" assigned to the \"level of experience\" could be subjectve).\n",
    "- \"subscribe\" is boolean, we will convert to 0 and 1 (:N nominal) for KNN\n",
    "- Drop rows with duplicated \"hashedEmail\". Ensure each player only gets to submit one response.\n",
    "- Standardize/Scale exploratory variables.\n",
    "- To properly split data, use stratify=y to balance the number of boolean in the testing vs training dataset.\n",

    "Issues with the model:\n",

    "Comparing and selecting the best model and processing the data to apply the model:\n",
    "1. Filter rows to keep: age, played hours, experience, and subscribe\n",
    "2. Fit 3 models of KNN classification (3 sets of 3 pairs of variables, variable ‘subscribe’ constant through all 3 models as \"colour\":N). -Models: age vs. played hours, age vs. experience, played hours vs. experience.\n",
    "3. Quantitative analysis: Split and cross-validation with training and testing (0.75, 0.25).\n",
    "   - Perform 5-fold cross-validation on each model to evaluate accuracy, precision and recall.\n",
    "5. Compare cross-validation results of the 3 models, and select the model with the highest combination of accuracy, precision and recall.\n",
